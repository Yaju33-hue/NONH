🚀 Who Am I?
I’m a driven software engineering student who’s passionate about solving real problems through clean, efficient code. Whether it’s cracking theory-heavy topics like computer architecture, applying differential equations to real-world phenomena, or refining C++ OOP design, I thrive on turning complexity into clarity.

I don’t just learn — I engineer. I like structure, rapid understanding, and practical tools for recall — including custom revision sheets and organized theory breakdowns.

💻 What I'm Working On
Developing OOP projects in C++

User friendly online applications along with perfecting my software design

Solving and applying First and Second Order ODEs (spiral motion, Newton's Law of Cooling)

Prepping for theory-heavy subjects like Computer Architecture

Practicing clean coding and revision workflows

Learning and understanding diverse pieces of knowledge and information from every field

This anime website obviously😆

🎯 How I Learn
Visual summaries and one-pagers

Blending theory with practical application

Breaking down tough problems into digestible code patterns

Always revising smarter, not harder

Basically i'm a hands on guy who's really intereted in learning and practicing

📺 What I Love
Lover of complexity and simplicity all at once

Appreciator of structure, design, and content that makes sense

The best feeling to me is when something is wrong and you know why it went wrong and exactly how to fix it
